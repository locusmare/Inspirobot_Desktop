Inspirobot Desktop is a simple Windows client (unofficial) to show inspirational quotes on your desktop using InspiroBot API. 
Every image created with InspiroBot API can be saved directly to program's location. 
Additionally if you change "Inspirobot_win32.exe" to "Inspirobot_win32-autosave.exe", it will automatically save the images after 
everytime getting a new quote.
